/* Concepts Demonstrated:
Encapsulation: Game state (board, current player, gameOver) is private to the class.
Control Structures: Nested loops for board traversal, if/else for validation and win checks.
User Input Handling: Uses Scanner for console-based input with validation logic.
Method Decomposition: Each function (checkWin, isDraw, printBoard) has a clear, single responsibility.
Reusability: The main logic (rules, win conditions) could be reused for GUI by separating model and view.
